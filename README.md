This repository contains my **personal implementations** of common data structures in the C programming language.  
All programs have been written by me during my college years as part of my learning journey in **Data Structures & Algorithms**.

The aim of this repo is to serve as:
- A reference for students & learners
- A collection of clean, well-documented C code
- A personal archive of my DSA journey
